## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## My name is Destiny. Iâ€™m a student-athlete majoring in Data Science with a passion for economics, Russian, and physics. Through Break Through Tech AI, Iâ€™m gaining foundational skills in AI and ML to explore their societal impacts. My goal is to work in finance as a data scientist, leveraging quantum computing to enhance cryptography and streamline portfolio management. Iâ€™m seeking opportunities to apply ML in the financial sector. Outside academics, I enjoy running and participating in mock trial.
